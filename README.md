# Augite's Elithian Additions
**DEPRECATED. I don't ever plan to resume working on this, but plan to send some of it to be integrated into the main Elithian Races mod.
Don't complain if stuff breaks because of various updates from other mods/the game itself.**

A mod designed to implement some of my custom content inspired by Aegonian's Elithian Races Starbound mod that wouldn't really fit into the main mod. 
This includes (not everything may be implemented as of writing):
- violated trink armor, weapons, furniture, an NPC, and a space encounter
- some minor rimdweller furniture, since it feels slightly incomplete
- a few more unique weapons
- one or more new end-game planet types
- a lot of books, because the main mod is mostly lacking them
- a new special location

(By the way, all the content here is fully free to use. Have fun.)

Oh, and the original mod is here. https://github.com/Aegonian/ElithianAllianceStarboundMod

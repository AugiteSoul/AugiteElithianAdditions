Hey, Augite here. If you are wondering what is this custom Aegi armor set, all you need to know is that it's
a custom set I made for my in-game character as an experiment. There is no legitimate way to obtain it, and I will never implement
a way to obtain it without cheats. I just decided to add it into Elithian Additions since I really didn't want to make another whole mod
just for 4-5 items. 

If you need to contact me, send me something on Discord (augitesoul#9628) or Twitter (@luoSetiguA) in either French or English, it's up to you.
Thanks to Aegonian for making such inspiring lore and content and to the members of the Discord server. You're the best.
